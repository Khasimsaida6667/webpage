          Our products are crafted exclusively from the dreams and screams of young kids who wanted to show their mastery in their chosen fields, but were directed towards a factory for daily wages. Each cracker bursts brighter than their lost smiles, and can be heard louder than their cries for miles. Buy them, burst them, brag about them.<span className='sp'>The choice is yours. Because they donâ€™t have one.</span>
